<p>People may ask, can we find an alternative construction material instead of cement? such as wood, steel. The annual usage of wood is much above the replanting level, and it is not possible to get wood in some places such as Africa and China. As for steel, it is costly and again the production of steel also gives CO2 emission. Furthermore, the production of cement is not that energy intensive compared with other materials.</p>

<p>Actually, it is not possible to find an alternative construction material. 98% of the earth’s crust is made of eight elements: O, Si, Al, Fe, Ca, Na, K, Mg, which are the main elements of cement as well. From the long term run, the world will still need a large amount of cement. The demand of cement mainly comes from developing countries, such as India and China because of the urbanization and its population growth.</p>

<p>Since we have to use cement in the future, how can we do to reduce the CO2 emission and what is the future of cement? Efforts have been doing ever since decades ago in the cement industry and research community.</p>
<p>On the one hand, cement plants nowadays burn (hazardous) waste, say, car tyres, as fuel to make cement. The wood floats on the water of Three Gorges Dam is even collected to make fuel for cement plants. On the other hand, the production process of cement has always been optimizing. Some cement plants can even reach 80% efficiency, which is a great achievement even from a theoretical standpoint.</p>

<p>Researchers of cement try to use less cement clinkers. One viable method is Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs). SCMs are commonly industry by-products or raw materials, such as Slag, limestone, Fly ash, silica fume, natural pozzolan. Whether binary blended or even ternary blended, SCMs can replace part of cement without sacrificing equivalent engineering properties.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the curve, the mass exceeded the original mass, which is not reasonable, since the decomposition of the sample always decrease the mass of testing sample. So why does this happen? This is because of the buoyancy effect in the TGA equipment.</p>
<p>Every substance found in a gas atmosphere is subjected to a buoyant force. This results in &#8220;apparent&#8221; mass changes. The degree of buoyancy, and thus the degree of mass change as well, are basically dependent on the volume of the substance and the density of the prevailing gas.</p>
<p>However, for thermogravimetric investigations, it is not the absolute value of the buoyancy at a certain temperature that is decisive, but rather its change as a function of temperature. A typical buoyancy curve is shown as follows.</p>

<p>It was recorded using a NETZSCH STA 409 with a DSC sample carrier in a static N2 atmosphere. There is no sample in the crucible, but the recorded result shows the mass is always over ZERO.</p>
<p>Due to the volume-dependence of the buoyancy, it is important to specify the sample carrier type in addition to the gas atmosphere, since different sample carrier/crucible combinations give rise to different &#8220;apparent&#8221; mass changes.</p>
<p><strong>How to remove the Buoyancy Effect?</strong></p>
<p>Knowing this, we can remove the buoyance effect by running a blank test. Repeat the test with the same crucible but without anything in it or with inert material, then the buoyancy effect is recorded. Subtracting the buoyancy result from the first measurement result, the true mass change of the test is obtained.</p>

<p><strong>Why does the buoyancy curve initially show such a drastic rise?</strong></p>
<p>You may find the buoyancy curve initially shows a drastic rise, why is that? This phenomenon arises from the design of TGA device.</p>
<p>At low temperatures, heat transfer from the furnace to the sample thermocouple is exclusively through convection. Since a certain amount of time is required before the crucible material is evenly heated and the warm air preferably flows along the inside of the protective tube, and thus does not reach the crucible immediately, the actual temperature of the gas atmosphere is far higher, particularly at the beginning of a measurement, than the temperature sensor indicates. Therefore, the gas density changes dramatically in the beginning of the test, thus subjects dramatic “apparent mass” change.</p>

<p><span id="more-402"></span>At the end of MIP, the intruded volume of mercury at corresponding pressure is recorded, which means the pore volume is known.

<p>The density of cement particles is commonly referred as 3.1 g/cm^3, and that of slag and limestone are 2.6 and 2.7 g/cm^3, respectively. You may be curious to know how about the bulk density of cement paste. Are they higher and lower than the raw materials? Are they stable values as curing ages extend and thus more hydration products formed?</p>
<p>Recently, several cement and blended paste samples of mine have been tested using MIP. I list the bulk density results as below. All the pastes are mixed at water : powder = 0.4, sealed and cured at 20 °C. As each scheduled curing age (1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 91 days) reaches, the hydration were stopped by liquid nitrogen, and later freeze dried to remove the frozen free water.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">From the results, the bulk density of cement or blended cement ranges between 1.4 to 1.8 g/cm^3, much lower than raw material, and blended cement paste, such as the ternary blended cement paste, constantly has lower bulk density. This show that the hydrating blended cement pastes are more porous, which are further confirmed by tested porosity results below.</span></p>

<p>The density of cement particles is commonly referred as 3.1 g/cm^3, and that of slag and limestone are 2.6 and 2.7 g/cm^3, respectively. You may be curious to know how about the bulk density of cement paste. Are they higher and lower than the raw materials? Are they stable values as curing ages extend and thus more hydration products formed?</p>
<p>Recently, several cement and blended paste samples of mine have been tested using MIP. I list the bulk density results as below. All the pastes are mixed at water : powder = 0.4, sealed and cured at 20 °C. As each scheduled curing age (1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 91 days) reaches, the hydration were stopped by liquid nitrogen, and later freeze dried to remove the frozen free water.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">From the results, the bulk density of cement or blended cement ranges between 1.4 to 1.8 g/cm^3, much lower than raw material, and blended cement paste, such as the ternary blended cement paste, constantly has lower bulk density. This show that the hydrating blended cement pastes are more porous, which are further confirmed by tested porosity results below.</span></p>

<p><strong>2 Calculation of reaction degree of slag</strong></p>
<p>Take Msl g slag and MCH g Ca(OH)2 and MH g H2O as reactant. When the test age reaches, say 3 days, take two pieces of paste, dry and weigh<br />
them, then,</p>
<ul>
<li>1. one is ground to powder for EDTA test;</li>
<li>2. the other piece undergoes a ignition loss test (LOI), from the LOI, the slag mass fraction in the dried paste powder can be determined, the ignition loss of CH should be taken into account, for Ca(OH)2 is decomposed to CaO and H2O.</li>
</ul>
<p>The LOI fraction is: fLOI, thus, 1 − fLOI is the mass fraction of CaO+slag, so the original slag content in the powder can be determined.</p>
<p><strong>2.1 Correction of hydrotalcite</strong></p>
<p>h= Mass of dried hydrotalcite formed from 1 g of MgO in the slag glass.</p>
<p>The value of h could be 2.35 g based on the assumption in the paper &#8220;Degrees of reaction of the slag in some blends with Portland cement&#8221;, there the hydrotalcite is considered as M5ACH7.</p>
<p>Therefore, the residue of slag should minus the residue formed from MgO. The content of MgO can be determined by the content of slag of the tested powder.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Correction of slag</strong></p>
<p>A small amount of slag may be solved in the reagent EDTA solution.</p>
<p>It is better do a pure unreacted slag test using EDTA, to determine the fraction of slag dissolution.</p>
<p>If the dissolution of slag in EDTA is quite small, then there is no need to take account for correction for solved unreacted slag in EDTA reagent, assuming no unreacted slag is solved in the EDTA solution.</p>

<p>The value of h could be 2.35 g based on the assumption in the paper &#8220;Degrees of reaction of the slag in some blends with Portland cement&#8221;, there the hydrotalcite is considered as M5ACH7.</p>
<p>Therefore, the residue of slag should minus the residue formed from MgO. The content of MgO can be determined by the content of slag of the tested powder.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Correction of slag</strong></p>
<p>A small amount of slag may be solved in the reagent EDTA solution.</p>
<p>It is better do a pure unreacted slag test using EDTA, to determine the fraction of slag dissolution.</p>
<p>If the dissolution of slag in EDTA is quite small, then there is no need to take account for correction for solved unreacted slag in EDTA reagent, assuming no unreacted slag is solved in the EDTA solution.</p>

<p><strong>1 Topochemical Reaction Concept</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-341"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Immediately after the first contact of the cement with water a calcium-rich silicious clinker would liberate Ca2+ ions into the solution. A calcium-poor skeleton is left which reacts with the calcium-rich solution which is accompanied by swelling of the hydration products compared with the original volume of the anhydrous cement.</p>
<p>The topochemical concept was launched by Michaelis at the beginning of last century. Since then topochemical phenomena have been reported for the hydration of both C3S and Portland cement.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>2 Through-Solution Concept</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>In the through-solution concept dissolution of the anhydrous grain after contact of the cement with water is considered to be followed by hydration in the solution. The hydration products then precipitate on the grain surface.</p>
<p>The through-solution concept was first formulated by Le Chatelier for plaster and Portland cement in the first decade of this century. The concept has been supported by many reserachers, Regourd et al., Brunauer and Gauglitz, Williamson and Dron et al.</p></blockquote>
<p>The debate on whether cement hydration proceeds topochemically or according to a through-solution mechanism dates back to the very beginning of cement chemistry. The subject is of significant importance in view of mathematical modeling of both the hydration process and structural formation. As such, a so-called Simultaneously Operating Mechanisms is proposed to account for the debate.</p>
<p><strong>3 Simultaneously Operating Mechanisms</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>According to Neville the controversy between the topochemical and through-solution concept can largely be reduced to a matter of terminology. Shebl et al. explains that hydration of C3S involves both through-solution reactions and topochemical reactions (solid-state reaction). The water/solid ratio would be an important factor in this respect. For low water/solid ratios the reaction would be predominantly topochemical, whereas for high water/solid ratios the through-solution mechanism would be more important. Both reactions could occur simultaneously.</p>
<p>The concept of simultaneously operating mechanisms is plausible indeed if the outer products, i.e. the products which are formed outside the original grain boundaries in a relatively water-rich environment, are formed by a through-solution mechanism, while the inner products, formed inside the original grain boundaries, are the result of a topochemical reaction.</p>
<p>From a literature survey on this topic Daimon concluded that it is very difficult to determine which mechanism has marred. The fact that we are dealing with a poly-size system significantly contributes to the complexity of the subject. Probably the effect of the particle size distribution also explains why Kalousek found many contradictions between different authors on this point.</p></blockquote>
<p>The conclusion is that <strong>the mechanism of cement hydration depends on the water/solid ratio, viz. low water/solid ratios lead to topochemical reaction, while through-solution mechanism is more important at high water/solid ratios, and both reactions could occur simultaneously.</strong></p>

<p><strong>How does 3D printer work to print a house?</strong></p>
<p>Here is how 3D printing works to &#8220;print&#8221; a house:</p>
<p>A CAD design is sent to a large-scale 3D printer that is mounted to a block of land. The printer lays out the concrete-like foundation of the home through a nozzle that can move anywhere on the property. Like any 3D print-out, the house is made layer-by-layer and reinforced with various materials — like electrical, plumbing and communication infrastructure — as the build progresses.</p>
<p>The process is super fast. In a <a href="http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxOjai-Behrokh-Khoshnevis-Con" target="_blank">TED presentation</a>,  Prof. Khoshnevis said that “we anticipate that an average house, like 2500 square foot house, can be built in about 20 hours from a custom design”.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JdbJP8Gxqog" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>As for the material used as the &#8220;printer ink&#8221;, concrete is the solution. The concrete used in the 3D house printer is a mixture of concrete and fibre polymers, meaning that it is more than three times stronger than traditional concrete used in today’s houses. The traditional concrete can withstand roughly 3000 pounds per square inch of pressure, while the new printed concrete can withstand around 10,000 pounds per square inch.</p>
<p><strong>Is it the future of cementitious materials in construction industry?</strong></p>
<p>Professor Khoshnevis says the method could be used to construct emergency or low-income housing. What is more, the concept is currently being supported by NASA so that the space agency can one day be used to build a colony on the Moon, and perhaps on the Mars, who knows.</p>
<p>As a cement researcher, I think the method is really revolutional in the construction industry, even just consider it from the theoretical concept. If the method is quite popular in the future, does it mean <a href="http://www.cementscience.com/2012/07/what-is-cement-and-its-history.html" target="_blank">cementitious materials</a> are the future of construction materials compared with steel? since the mixture &#8220;concrete&#8221; is the main material in the 3D printing machine used as &#8220;printing ink&#8221;.</p>

During the 13th ICCC, there were more than 900 participants from over 60 countries all over the world, received more than 400 papers on cement science, which cover 9 subjects:</p>
<p><span id="more-301"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>1.- Production process chemistry and engineering</li>
<li>2.- Sustainable production</li>
<li>3.- New cementitious matrix</li>
<li>4.- Hydration and microstructure</li>
<li>5.- Hydration and thermodynamics</li>
<li>6.- Modelling</li>
<li>7.- Properties of fresh and hardened concrete</li>
<li>8.- Concrete durability</li>
<li>9.- Standardization</li>
</ul>
<p>When reading papers, I saw numerous researchers refer to the information from the papers of ICCC, unfortunately, those proceedings of earlier age are not easy to find, since they are no digital version (like PDF files), or they are not open to the public. Even for the latest proceedings, you have to attend the meetings to get the proceedings, but the cost to attend these meetings is expensive or at least not cheap. What is even worse is that every meeting is definitely not available for all people in the field, due to the difficulties such as travelling and time schedule.</p>

<p>The purpose of conference is to gather people who are interested on some issues in the same field to discuss and share latest results. As a result of meetings, the proceedings paper is a good media to store and spread these information. So we should make these proceedings open for the related researchers rather than close them for a small group of researchers, which is not the REAL Science, Science should be OPEN, and must be OPEN.</p>
<p>I have attended the 13th ICCC thanks to the financial support from my promoter, and got a digital proceedings of the conference. I think it is a good idea to share them with you who are also a researcher on cement science.

The conference takes place every four years. The latest one is the 13th ICCC hosted in Madrid Spain in 2011 and the next one 14th ICCC will be hosted in Beijing in 2015. During the 13th ICCC, there were more than 900 participants from over 60 countries all over the world, received more than 400 papers on cement science, which cover 9 subjects:</p>
<p><span id="more-301"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>1.- Production process chemistry and engineering</li>
<li>2.- Sustainable production</li>
<li>3.- New cementitious matrix</li>
<li>4.- Hydration and microstructure</li>
<li>5.- Hydration and thermodynamics</li>
<li>6.- Modelling</li>
<li>7.- Properties of fresh and hardened concrete</li>
<li>8.- Concrete durability</li>
<li>9.- Standardization</li>
</ul>
<p>When reading papers, I saw numerous researchers refer to the information from the papers of ICCC, unfortunately, those proceedings of earlier age are not easy to find, since they are no digital version (like PDF files), or they are not open to the public. Even for the latest proceedings, you have to attend the meetings to get the proceedings, but the cost to attend these meetings is expensive or at least not cheap. What is even worse is that every meeting is definitely not available for all people in the field, due to the difficulties such as travelling and time schedule.</p>

<p>The purpose of conference is to gather people who are interested on some issues in the same field to discuss and share latest results. As a result of meetings, the proceedings paper is a good media to store and spread these information. So we should make these proceedings open for the related researchers rather than close them for a small group of researchers, which is not the REAL Science, Science should be OPEN, and must be OPEN.</p>
<p>I have attended the 13th ICCC thanks to the financial support from my promoter, and got a digital proceedings of the conference. I think it is a good idea to share them with you who are also a researcher on cement science. Just click the link <a href="http://goo.gl/3q34C" target="_blank"><strong>Proceedings of 13th International Congress on the Chemistry of Cement</strong></a> to download them onto your computer or copy the whole folder to your DropBox account.</p>
<p>Share them and make science OPEN.</p>
